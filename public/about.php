        <p class="show-ad"> I believe in comfort. If you don't feel comfortable in your clothes, it's hard to think of anything else. 
            In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different. A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous. 
            I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy. 
            Fashion is always of the time in which you live. It is not something standing alone. 
            But the grand problem, the most important problem, is to rejeuvenate women. To make women look young. Then their outlook changes. They feel more joyous.</p>
        <h3 class="profile-text">What We do?</h3>

        <p class="show-ad">It's sometimes said that I'm rebellious and I do things to push people's buttons, but I just like the challenge. 
            Doing collections, doing fashion is like a non-stop dialogue. 
            I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy. 
            Elegance is not the prerogative of those who have just escaped from adolescence, but of those who have already taken possession of their future. 
            It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion.</p>
        <h3 class="profile-text">We <i class="fa fa-heartbeat fa-2x"></i> Fashion</h3>

        <p class="show-ad">Women are women, and hurray for that. If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look better. 
            Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul. Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity. 
            Men don't want another man to look at their woman because they don't know how to handle it.</p>
